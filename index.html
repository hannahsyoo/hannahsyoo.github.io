			<h3> What an Egg-cellent End of the Semester!
			<h4> December 24, 2015
			<h5> It's Christmas Eve, but more importantly, it's been two days since I have officially finished my first semester of college! The past few weeks have been all about final papers and exams. But, if you're like me and don't like staying in one place studying, you plan study breaks with your friends. I decided to plan a small excursion downtown to Kate Werble's gallery. And can I just say that it was egg-xactly what I needed for a proper study break. The amount of glass eggs in that small space was a little overwhelming to say the least, but it was an egg-travant gallery and definitely an interesting concept. Afterwards, my friends and I decided to get cookie shots from Dominique Ansel Bakery to #TreatOurselves before heading back to campus and back to work.
